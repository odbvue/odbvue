# Local Development

Install [Podman](https://podman.io/) on your local machine. Podman is a daemon-less container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI containers, needed for creating consistent development environments that match production. For Windows users, this will require setting up WSL. Follow the guide [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman-for-windows.md).
