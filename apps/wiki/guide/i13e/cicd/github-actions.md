# GitHub Actions

## Overview

### What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform built directly into GitHub. It automates your software development workflow by running jobs in response to events in your repository. In OdbVue's case, it automates building and deploying your applications to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure whenever you release a new version.
