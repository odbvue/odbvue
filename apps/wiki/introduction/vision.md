# Why OdbVue?

## Vision

With emerge of AI, barriers preventing non IT organizations to take ownership of their technology, vanishes. What once was someones unique knowledge now has become a commodity. It is the right time to replace vendor dependency with lean, AI-enabled, in-house IT teams and modern, secure infrastructure.

When digital operations are in-house, feedback loops shorten. Data stays internal. Productivity increases - not through layoffs, but through ownership.

Over time, these in-house systems evolve into living digital organisms constantly tuned by the people who use them. That is not just cost optimization - that is competitive differentiation.

## Platform

**OdbVue** is the platform that helps in this transformation journey. Built on the best of two worlds 

- as enterprise as it can get [Oracle Data base](https://www.oracle.com/database/) ensuring the absolute top class for resilience, performance and security, and

- a true open source community driven [Vue Ecosystem](https://vuejs.org/) giving modern and smooth end-user experience.

**OdbVue** is the platform built with the **Simplicity**, **Scalability**, and **Security** in mind

- *do you really need this* instead of *how you need this*

- only necessary minimum of traffic between user's device and server

- navigation guards on the first and the last frontiers

## Team

With **OdbVue** and AI working together, a lean team of just 3-5 professionals can fully develop, deploy, and maintain enterprise-grade features that once required departments of dozens. AI handles the heavy lifting - generating code, writing tests, drafting documentation, and accelerating debugging - while team focuses on what truly matters: understanding the business, making decisions, and delivering value. The platform's unified stack eliminates the need for separate specialists for frontend, backend, database, and DevOps - one empowered team covers it all.

This isn't about doing more with less - it is about doing *better* with *focus*. Small teams move faster, communicate clearer, and adapt quicker. When combined with AI-augmented development and a battle-tested Oracle + Vue foundation, they can compete with - and often outperform - traditional enterprise IT organizations. **OdbVue** is built for this new reality: where ownership beats outsourcing, and agility beats bureaucracy.
