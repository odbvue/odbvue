# OdbVue Demo Application --- Terms & Conditions

**1. Purpose of the Service**

The OdbVue Demo Application ("the Service") is provided solely for
demonstration, testing, and evaluation of technical capabilities related
to OdbVue technologies. The Service is not intended for production use,
commercial deployment, or handling of critical or sensitive data. By
using the Service, you acknowledge that it is offered strictly for
experimental and informational purposes.

**2. Open-Source Availability**

The underlying OdbVue project is open-source and freely available on
GitHub under the MIT License. The source code can be copied, forked,
modified, redistributed, and incorporated into other projects in
accordance with the MIT License terms. These Terms & Conditions apply
only to the hosted demo service and do not restrict your rights granted
by the MIT License for the open-source project.

**3. No Warranties**

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without any
warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This includes, but
is not limited to, warranties of accuracy, reliability, availability,
performance, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The
provider does not guarantee that the Service will function
uninterrupted, be error-free, secure, or meet any specific technical
requirements.

**4. Limitation of Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service provider assumes
zero liability for any damages arising from your access to or use of the
Service. This includes direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
special damages related to data loss, corruption, system issues,
downtime, or any decisions made using the Service's output. You
acknowledge that you use the demo entirely at your own risk.

**5. User Responsibilities**

You are solely responsible for any information or data you input into
the Service. Because the demo environment is not intended for
confidential, sensitive, or production data, you agree not to upload
such information. You accept that any data you provide may be lost,
modified, deleted, or exposed due to the experimental nature of the
platform.

**6. Modifications and Termination**

The Service provider reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate
the Service at any time without notice. These Terms & Conditions may be
updated periodically, and continued use of the Service constitutes
acceptance of the latest version. If you do not agree with any updated
terms, you must stop using the Service.
